Game Description

For this assignment, I decided to implement a 3D platformer game, with a timed parkour course to a goal.

What is the main action in the game
 - The main action in the game is running around and jumping. This is how you complete the course to win the game

What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal
 - I would say the most difficult part of the game to implement was getting the timer to work properly. 
   Since I used levels to distinguish the main menu and end menu, transferring the elapsed time to a new level was particularly hard for me,
   as I had initially stored it in the thirdpersoncharacter blueprint, but I learnt this gets reset each level, so the finished time was always saying
   0 seconds. I had to learn about how to implement global variables, and ended up doing something like this by creating a gameInstance class and storing the time in there,
   as this did not get reset each level

What is the most interesting part of the game 
 - I really like the rotating platforms in the parkour course, as I made them do a cool rotation, as it is not just a simple continuous spinning but rather 
   it reverses direction halfway through, which I had fun implementing and playing.
